  <h3>So There are those who deserve to gain weight and there are those who deserve to lose weight.</h3>
<h3>Gaining weight means that a person needs a period of amplification and body building .</h3>
<h3>Losing weight means that a person needs a period of drying and burning fat . </h3>

<div class="R">
<h2 class=" M ">What is the difference between amplification and drying ?</h2>

<h3>The difference between amplification and drying is basically that you gain weight in amplification ⬆ and reduce weight in drying ⬇ I mean the amplification system is a program and diet prepared to increase muscle mass, while drying is an exercise program and diet prepared for fat loss.</h3>
<br>
</div>


<div class="R">
<h2 class=" M ">Is it supposed to be bigger or thinner ? </h2>
<h3>If the percentage of fat is 15% or more (20% for girls), drying remains the ideal goal for you But if you are within 10-12%, focus on amplification I mean the shape of the good form of the body will be between 10 and 15% of the proportion of fat Fat in the body, but if it exceeds 15%, the body shape will start showing fat.</h3>
</div>

<div class="R">
<h2 class=" M ">How long does drying take ?</h2>
<h3>This depends on the amount of fat that you need to get rid of, I mean, for example, if you want to lose five kilos of fat or less, give yourself one to three months to achieve this, and if you want to lose from five to ten kilos, the matter can take 3-5 months, meaning all The more fat you want to burn, the more time.</h3>
<br>
</div>
<div class="R">
<h2 class=" M ">Does the largest and dryest benefit at the same time ?</h2>
<h3>You can lose fat and build muscle at the same time, but the percentage will not be equal I mean, don't expect that for every kilo of fat you lose, you will find the same muscle.. why?
Because the rate of fat burning will be much higher than the increase in muscle, and the best thing you can expect is that you will build a small percentage of muscle in order to burn a large rate of fat.
In order to gain 2.5 kilos of muscle, it will take 3-4 months, but in order to lose fat at the same rate, you will do it in 3-4 weeks. Well, this means that instead of trying to inflate and dry out at the same time, it is better that you work on one thing, the first, and then the second.</h3>
<br>
</div>

<div class="R">
<h2 class=" M " >How do I dry up after amplification ?</h2>
<h3>The difference between bulking and deflating is mainly the diet. In bulking, you focus on gaining weight and building muscle, and in order to dry up after bulking up, you need to reduce the amount of food you eat so that you can reduce calories.
For example, reduce by about 20-25% less than your normal consumption. Calorie reduction can come from carbohydrates and fats or a mixture of the two.</h3>
<br>

</div>

<div class="R">
<h2 class=" M ">How do I get lean muscle while bulking up ?</h2>
<h3>In two <ins>ways</ins> to amplify :</h3>


  <ul>
    <li>The first method is called “ dirty bulk ”, and this method involves eating a lot of calories and fat in a random way, and from any sources.</li>
<li>There is another method called “ clean bulk ”, and in this method, they eat a lot of calories, but only from natural food sources.</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <ol>
    The dirty bulk diet includes a huge amount of calories, and it does not matter what type of food you eat and the quantity, and your main goal is to gain a lot of weight in the least amount of time.
    The Clean bulk system includes fewer excess calories and a greater focus on quality food, the idea of ​​which is to build muscle while reducing the percentage of fat gained.</h3>
